# Learning Golang
Started to learn Go, Here are some code I made

## [registry_putty.go](https://github.com/flaith-nycd/learning-golang/blob/master/registry_putty.go)
Golang program to get the Putty's sessions from the registry

## [cmpl.cmd](https://github.com/flaith-nycd/learning-golang/blob/master/cmpl.cmd)
Command file to compile Golang source code file and compress it, if you want to, to the maximum with [UPX](https://github.com/upx/upx)

* Compile
```
cmpl <filename>.go
```

* With the compression (add, at the END, the option `-u`)
```
cmpl <filename>.go -u
```
